# Arius

Arius is a simple rpg where the main character has to battle trough different stages of enemies to reach the final boss.
To help him in his journey, he has a trusted ally.
Arius, the main character, can buy items from the shop witch can be equipped in his, or his ally's inventory.
He also has access to a skill tree where he can unlock and upgrade abilities.
Arius can also save his progress and load it later, if he chooses.

## Implementation

The game is made entirely in Python, using the Pygame library.

## Instructions

Run the game by running the `game1.py` file.

In the title screen you can choose to start a new game or load a saved game.

The main screen has buttons to acces the shop, the skill tree, the inventory and the next stage of enemies.
Before going into the next stage, make sure to equip your items and abilities.

Pygame is not a game engine, so we didn't have many facilities, unlike Godot.
This problem got solved by reading documentation and searching the web.
